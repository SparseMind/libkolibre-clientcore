History
---------------------------------
The software development started in 2002 by Norra Österbottens Svenska
Synskadade rf (NÖSS), a Finnish non-profit contact, interest and service
organization for visually impaired. NÖSS sought for a solution together with
Jakobstads Tidning (today Österbottens Tidning)to modernize the daily talking
newspaper which back then was distributed by tape.

Since then several projects, mainly funded by the Finnish Slot Machine
Association, have been carried out in conjunction with other partners (i.e.
Pratsam Ab) to improve and further develop the software for different needs:

  2003-2004:
  Den Digitala Taltidningen, (Eng. The digital talking newspaper)

  2005-2006:
  Digital Service för Synskadade, (Eng. Digital Services For Visually Impaired)

  2007-2008:
  Ett tillgängligt informationssamhälle, (Eng. An Accessible Information Society)

  2009-2012:
  Hjälpmedel för jämställdhet, (Eng. Aids For Equality)
